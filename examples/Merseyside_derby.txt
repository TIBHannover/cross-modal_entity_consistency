Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard believes he proved he ‘is not finished yet’ after his tenth Merseyside derby goal in the 1-1 draw with Everton.

Gerrard has come under criticism at the start of the season, and for 92 minutes at Anfield he thought he was going to be the matchwinner.

“I can take constructive criticism, but people go one step further and say you’re finished and can’t run anymore and that's the frustrating things. So it’s nice to remind people I can still play and I am still around,” said Gerrard.

Satisfaction with the 65th-minute opening goal was balanced by the outcome, however. Brendan Rodgers, the Liverpool manager, felt his side were denied what would have been a deserved victory by Phil Jagielka’s wonderstrike on 92 minutes, while Everton boss Roberto Martinez said the equaliser was the best goal he has ever seen live.
